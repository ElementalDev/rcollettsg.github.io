          <h3>Trainee IT Consultant at Sparta Global | Junior Software Developer</h3>
          <p class="aboutMeTxt">
            My name is Reece Collett and I am a trainee IT Consultant at Sparta Global. Sparta has and is
            currently teaching me a lot of skills and different technologies that I can use when on client site to meet their
            requirements and more! There are many different objectives that we are covering; from business skills to full-stack
            developement
          </p>
          <p class="aboutMeTxt">
            Before Sparta Global, I was a Security Officer with the University of Essex, but I had been interested in programming
            since Year 9. The secondary school I attended Shoeburyness High School in Shoeburyness, Essex. After obtaining 11
            GCSEs and a BTEC in PE, I then continued on with my A-Levels at SEEVIC College in Benfleet, Essex, where i first became
            exposed to my first high level programming language, C#.Net. I wrote my final project in it and became very comfortable
            with it. From there, I was eager to learn more, and so I did!
          </p>
          <p class="aboutMeTxt">
            Although I didn't attend university, that didn't stop my passion for coding, and so I went out to work to pay for
            courses and exams for technical qualifications. I successfully completed:
            <ul class="quals">
              <li>Microsoft Technical Associate: Software Developement Fundementals</li>
              <li>CIW HTML and CSS Specialist Qualification</li>
              <li>W3Schools Certified JavaScript Developer</li>

            This project is still a work in progress. The game involves the player
            choosing a profession at the beginning of the game. All the professions,
            weapons, armours and enemies have an is-a relationship with classes of the
            same name to prevent having to rewrite code that is common. They then need
            to choose a difficulty, which will determine how many moves they have to escape
            the cave. They then have to escape by going either forward, back, left or right.
            A RND determines when enemies spawn and when helpful items spawn so the user
            cant determine when something is going to happen. Once they escape, they can have
            one of 3 different endings, depending on how they got out, what they collected and
            their health at the end. This was done using several classes and procedures as well
